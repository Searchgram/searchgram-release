# Searchgram

Searchgram is an unofficial Telegram app with improved chat search functionality.

- It features a search engine that can search for messages in **Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other languages**.
- It supports searching in a chat folder.
- When searching for contacts and chats, it supports partial text matching instead of requiring a full word match like the official Telegram app.
- Additionally, it supports searching in secure chats, which was previously only available on Telegram iOS app.
- Furthermore, the new search function **only runs on your device**, meaning no message content is sent outside of your phone.

# Releases

Publishing an unofficial Telegram client to Google Play can be difficult due to restrictions from both Telegram and the Google Play review team. For this reason, we recommend downloading the binaries from Github Releases instead: https://github.com/Searchgram/searchgram-release/releases.
