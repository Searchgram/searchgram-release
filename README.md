# Searchgram

Searchgram is an unofficial Telegram app with improved chats search.

- A new search engine that works for messages in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other languages.
- Search for contacts and chats supports partial text match instead of full word match from the official Telegram app.
- Search in secure chats is supported. You don't need to envy iOS Telegram anymore.
- The new search function ONLY runs on your device, no message content is sent outside your phone.
